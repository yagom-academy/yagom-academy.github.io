# Fundamentals
- **Clarity at the point of use** is your most important goal. Entities such as methods and properties are declared only once but used repeatedly. Design APIs to make those uses clear and concise. When evaluating a design, reading a declaration is seldom sufficient; always examine a use case to make sure it looks clear in context.

- **Clarity is more important than brevity.** Although Swift code can be compact, it is a non-goal to enable the smallest possible code with the fewest characters. Brevity in Swift code, where it occurs, is a side-effect of the strong type system and features that naturally reduce boilerplate.

- **Write a documentation comment for every declaration.** Insights gained by writing documentation can have a profound impact on your design, so don’t put it off.   

  > If you are having trouble describing your API’s functionality in simple terms, you may have designed the wrong API.

  <details>
  <summary>DETAIL</summary>
  <div markdown="1">   

  - **Use Swift’s dialect of Markdown.**

  - **Begin with a summary** that describes the entity being declared. Often, an API can be completely understood from its declaration and its summary.

    ```swift
    /// Returns a "view" of `self` containing the same elements in
    /// reverse order.
    func reversed() -> ReverseCollection
    ```

    <details>

    <div markdown="1">

    - **Focus on the summary**; it’s the most important part. Many excellent documentation comments consist of nothing more than a great summary.

    - **Use a single sentence fragment** if possible, ending with a period. Do not use a complete sentence.

    - **Describe what a function or method does and what it *returns*,** omitting null effects and Void returns:

    ```swift
    /// Inserts `newHead` at the beginning of `self`.
    mutating func prepend(_ newHead: Int)

    /// Returns a `List` containing `head` followed by the elements
    /// of `self`.
    func prepending(_ head: Element) -> List

    /// Removes and returns the first element of `self` if non-empty;
    /// returns `nil` otherwise.
    mutating func popFirst() -> Element?
    ```

    Note: in rare cases like popFirst above, the summary is formed of multiple sentence fragments separated by semicolons.

    - **Describe what a subscript accesses**:
    ```swift
    /// Accesses the `index`th element.
    subscript(index: Int) -> Element { get set }
    ```

    - **Describe what an initializer creates**:
    ```swift
    /// Creates an instance containing `n` repetitions of `x`.
    init(count n: Int, repeatedElement x: Element)
    ```

    - For all other declarations, **describe what the declared entity *is*.**
    ```swift
    /// A collection that supports equally efficient insertion/removal
    /// at any position.
    struct List {

      /// The element at the beginning of `self`, or `nil` if self is
      /// empty.
      var first: Element?
      ...
    ```

    </div>
    </details>

  - **Optionally, continue** with one or more paragraphs and bullet items. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines and use complete sentences.

    ```swift
    /// Writes the textual representation of each    ← Summary
    /// element of `items` to the standard output.
    ///                                              ← Blank line
    /// The textual representation for each item `x` ← Additional discussion
    /// is generated by the expression `String(x)`.
    ///
    /// - Parameter separator: text to be printed    ⎫
    ///   between items.                             ⎟
    /// - Parameter terminator: text to be printed   ⎬ Parameters section
    ///   at the end.                                ⎟
    ///                                              ⎭
    /// - Note: To print without a trailing          ⎫
    ///   newline, pass `terminator: ""`             ⎟
    ///                                              ⎬ Symbol commands
    /// - SeeAlso: `CustomDebugStringConvertible`,   ⎟
    ///   `CustomStringConvertible`, `debugPrint`.   ⎭
    public func print(
      _ items: Any..., separator: String = " ", terminator: String = "\n")
    ```

    - **Use recognized [symbol documentation markup elements](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/SymbolDocumentation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH51-SW1)** to add information beyond the summary, whenever appropriate.

    - **Know and use recognized bullet items with [symbol command syntax](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/SymbolDocumentation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH51-SW13).** Popular development tools such as Xcode give special treatment to bullet items that start with the following keywords:
